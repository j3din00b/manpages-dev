NAME
       progress - Coreutils Progress Viewer

SYNOPSIS
       progress [ -qdwmM ] [ -W secs ] [ -c command ] [ -a command ] [ -p pid ]
       progress -v | --version
       progress -h | --help

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the progress command.

       This  tool can be described as a Tiny, Dirty, C command that looks for coreutils basic commands (cp, mv, dd, tar, gzip/gunzip, cat, etc.) currently running on your system and dis‚Äê
       plays the percentage of copied data.

       It can now also estimate throughput (using flag -w).

OPTIONS
       -q (--quiet)
              hides all messages

       -d (--debug)
              shows all warning/error messages

       -w (--wait)
              estimate I/O throughput and estimated remaining time (slower display)

       -W (--wait-delay secs)
              wait 'secs' seconds for I/O estimation (implies -w)

       -m (--monitor)
              loop while monitored processes are still running

       -M (--monitor-continuously)
              like monitor but never stop (similar to watch progress)

       -c (--command cmd)
              monitor only this command name (ex: firefox). This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

       -a (--additional-command cmd)
              add this command to the default list. This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

       -p (--pid id)
              monitor only this numeric process ID (ex: `pidof firefox`). This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

       -i (--ignore-file file)
              do not report a process for 'file'. If the file does not exist yet, you must give a full and clean absolute path. This option can be used  multiple  times  on  the  command
              line.

       -o (--open-mode {r|w})
              report only files opened for read or write by the process. This option is useful when you want to monitor only output files (or input ones) of a process.

       -v (--version)
              show program version and exit

       -h (--help)
              display help message and exit

ENVIRONMENT
       It's possible to give permanent options using PROGRESS_ARGS environment variable.  See example below. Command line arguments take precedence over environment.

EXAMPLES
       Continuously monitor all current and upcoming instances of coreutils commands

              watch progress -q

       See how your download is progressing

              watch progress -wc firefox

       Look at your Web server activity

              progress -c httpd

       Launch and monitor any heavy command using $!

              cp bigfile newfile & progress -mp $!

       Use environment variable to set permanent (multiple) arguments

              export PROGRESS_ARGS='-M --ignore-file ~/.xsession-errors'
