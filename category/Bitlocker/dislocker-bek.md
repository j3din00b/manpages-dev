NAME
       dislocker-bek - Reads .BEK files and prints information about them

SYNOPSIS
       dislocker-bek [-f file.bek]

DESCRIPTION
       Dislocker has been designed to read BitLocker encrypted partitions under a Linux system. The driver used to read volumes encrypted in Windows system versions
       of the Vista to 10 and BitLocker-To-Go encrypted partitions,that's USB/FAT32 partitions.

       BEK file is a BitLocker Encryption Key. BitLocker Drive Encryption is a full disk encryption feature included with the Microsoft's Windows versions Vista  to
       10. It is designed to protect data by providing encryption for entire volumes.

       The  software works with driver composed of a library, with multiple binaries using this library. Decrypting the partition, you have to give it a mount point
       where, once keys are decrypted, a file named dislocker-file appears.  This file is a virtual NTFS partition, so you can mount it as any  NTFS  partition  and
       then read from or write to it. Writing to the NTFS virtual file will change the underlying BitLocker partition content.

       This tool is useful in cryptography managing and forensics investigations.
