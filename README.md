# README

This project is for:
> Kaisen Linux | Manpages

## How to generate the manpages-documentaion

- You can modify a md file in category\ or packages\ then,

run the script :

```bash
./mix_build.sh # build for website production
./mix_build.sh --package #Â build for kaisen-webdocs debian package
# if the command is successful, you can view the doc with your browser
# firefox doc/index.html (manpages sorted by category)
# firefox doc/packages/readme.html (manpages sorted by packages A-Z)
```

## How to add a page to the documentation

- If you want to add a md file, you have to create a md in category\ or packages\ folder, then add a line in mix_category.exs or mix_packages.exs, then

  example: README.md was added to category\ and packages\ and a line in mix_category.exs and mix_packages.exs were added.

then run the script :

```bash
./mix_build.sh (or mix_build.sh --package if you build for debian package)
# if the command is successful, you can view the doc with your browser
# firefox doc/index.html (manpages sorted by category)
# firefox doc/packages/readme.html (manpages sorted by packages A-Z)
```

# Install the requirements if necessary

After git cloning this directory:  

You can use the following script to install **git, erlang and elixir** via **asdf manager** :

```bash
# you must have a sudo user
chmod +x install-requirements.sh && ./install-requirements.sh
```

```bash
# then enter the following command to install erlang and elixir via asdf
asdf plugin add erlang && asdf plugin add elixir
asdf install erlang 23.3.1
asdf install elixir 1.11.4-otp-23
# you have to define a global version for erlang and elixir
asdf global elixir 1.11.4-otp-23
asdf global erlang 23.3.1 
```
