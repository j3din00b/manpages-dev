## NAME
        guymager - a forensic acquisition program
 
## SYNOPSIS
        guymager [log=log_file] [cfg=configuration_file] [options]
 
## DESCRIPTION
        Guymager  is a Qt-based forensic imager. It is capable of producing image files in EWF, AFF and dd format. Its main strenghs are the easy user interface, the
        high imaging speed and the extended acquisition info file.
 
        The internal structure is based on separate threads for reading, hash calculation (MD5 and SHA256), writing and includes a parallelised  compression  engine,
        thus making full usage of multi-processor and hyper-threading machines.
 
        Guymager should be run with root privileges, as other users do not have access to physical devices normally.
 
## OPTIONS
        log=log_file
               By default, guymager uses /var/log/guymager.log as its log file. This option allows for specifying a different file.
 
        cfg=configuration_file
               The default configuration file is /etc/guymager/guymager.cfg. This option allows for specifying a different file. Guymager creates a template configu‚Äê
               ration file when the option -cfg=template.cfg is given.
 
        All other configuration options may be specified on the command line and/or in the configuration file. See /etc/guymager/guymager.cfg for  a  description  of
        all possible options. In case an option is specified in the configuration file and on the command line, the command line dominates.
 
 EXIT CODES
        Guymager normally returns an exit code of 0. Exit code 1 means that Guymager terminated because the AutoExit function became active. All other exit codes are
        related to internal Guymager or Qt errors.
 
## EXAMPLES
        Write all log entries to ./my.log:
               guymager log=my.log
 
        Create a template configuration file
               guymager cfg=template.cfg
 
        Read the configuration from my.cfg and use 4 threads for parallelised compression:
               guymager cfg=my.cfg CompressionThreads=4
 
        See /etc/guymager/guymager.cfg for details about option CompressionThreads and all other options as well.
