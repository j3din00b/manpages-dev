## NAME
        pigz, unpigz - compress or expand files
 
## SYNOPSIS
        pigz [ -cdfhikKlLmMnNqrRtz0..9,11 ] [ -b blocksize ] [ -p threads ] [ -S suffix ] [ name ...  ]
        unpigz [ -cfhikKlLmMnNqrRtz ] [ -b blocksize ] [ -p threads ] [ -S suffix ] [ name ...  ]
 
## DESCRIPTION
        Pigz compresses using threads to make use of multiple processors and cores.  The input is broken up into 128 KB chunks with each compressed in parallel.  The
        individual check value for each chunk is also calculated in parallel.  The compressed data is written in order to the output, and a combined check  value  is
        calculated from the individual check values.
 
        The compressed data format generated is in the gzip, zlib, or single-entry zip format using the deflate compression method.  The compression produces partial
        raw deflate streams which are concatenated by a single write thread and wrapped with the appropriate header and trailer, where the trailer contains the  com‐
        bined check value.
 
        Each  partial raw deflate stream is terminated by an empty stored block (using the Z_SYNC_FLUSH option of zlib), in order to end that partial bit stream at a
        byte boundary.  That allows the partial streams to be concatenated simply as sequences of bytes.  This adds a very small four to five byte  overhead  to  the
        output for each input chunk.
 
        The  default  input block size is 128K, but can be changed with the -b option.  The number of compress threads is set by default to the number of online pro‐
        cessors, which can be changed using the -p option.  Specifying -p 1 avoids the use of threads entirely.
 
        The input blocks, while compressed independently, have the last 32K of the previous block loaded as a preset dictionary to preserve  the  compression  effec‐
        tiveness  of deflating in a single thread.  This can be turned off using the -i or --independent option, so that the blocks can be decompressed independently
        for partial error recovery or for random access. This also inserts an extra empty block to flag independent blocks by prefacing each with the  nine-byte  se‐
        quence (in hex): 00 00 FF FF 00 00 00 FF FF.
 
        Decompression  can't  be parallelized, at least not without specially prepared deflate streams for that purpose.  As a result, pigz uses a single thread (the
        main thread) for decompression, but will create three other threads for reading, writing, and check calculation, which can speed up decompression under  some
        circumstances.  Parallel decompression can be turned off by specifying one process ( -dp 1 or -tp 1 ).
 
        All  options  on  the  command line are processed before any names are processed.  If no names are provided on the command line, or if "-" is given as a name
        (but not after "--"), then the input is taken from stdin.
 
        Compressed files can be restored to their original form using pigz -d or unpigz.
 
## OPTIONS
        -# --fast --best
               Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit #, where -1 or --fast indicates the fastest compression method (less compression)  and  -9
               or  --best indicates the slowest compression method (best compression).  -0 is no compression.  -11 gives a few percent better compression at a severe
               cost in execution time, using the zopfli algorithm by Jyrki Alakuijala.  The default is -6.
 
        -b --blocksize mmm
               Set compression block size to mmmK (default 128KiB).
 
        -c --stdout --to-stdout
               Write all processed output to stdout (won't delete).
 
        -d --decompress --uncompress
               Decompress the compressed input.
 
        -f --force
               Force overwrite, compress .gz, links, and to terminal.
 
        -h --help
               Display a help screen and quit.
 
        -i --independent
               Compress blocks independently for damage recovery.
 
        -k --keep
               Do not delete original file after processing.
 
        -K --zip
               Compress to PKWare zip (.zip) single entry format.
 
        -l --list
               List the contents of the compressed input.
 
        -L --license
               Display the pigz license and quit.
 
        -m --no-time
               Do not store or restore the modification time. -Nm will store or restore the name, but not the modification time. Note that the order of  the  options
               is important.
 
        -M --time
               Store  or  restore the modification time. -nM will store or restore the modification time, but not the name. Note that the order of the options is im‐
               portant.
 
        -n --no-name
               Do not store or restore the file name or the modification time. This is the default when decompressing. When the file name is not  restored  from  the
               header, the name of the compressed file with the suffix stripped is the name of the decompressed file. When the modification time is not restored from
               the header, the modification time of the compressed file is used (not the current time).
 
        -N --name
               Store or restore both the file name and the modification time. This is the default when compressing.
 
        -p --processes n
               Allow up to n processes (default is the number of online processors)
 
        -q --quiet --silent
               Print no messages, even on error.
 
        -r --recursive
               Process the contents of all subdirectories.
 
        -R --rsyncable
               Input-determined block locations for rsync.
 
        -S --suffix .sss
               Use suffix .sss instead of .gz (for compression).
 
        -t --test
               Test the integrity of the compressed input.
 
        -v --verbose
               Provide more verbose output.
 
        -V --version
               Show the version of pigz. -vV also shows the zlib version.
 
        -z --zlib
               Compress to zlib (.zz) instead of gzip format.
 
        --     All arguments after "--" are treated as file names (for names that start with "-")
 
        These options are unique to the -11 compression level:
 
        -F --first
               Do iterations first, before block split (default is last).
 
        -I, --iterations n
               Number of iterations for optimization (default 15).
 
        -J, --maxsplits n
               Maximum number of split blocks (default 15).
 
        -O --oneblock
               Do not split into smaller blocks (default is block splitting).
